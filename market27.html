It was just hard to find people work and  the number of tables we could seat people at so limited. There's 5,000 of us across Colorado, and almost all of us providing home delivery rely on a delivery service.  When 30% of your safes are in beer,  wine and cocktails.  home delivery presents a  revenue stream that could rescue the restaurant industry."

                     1. Good food, reasonable price, nostalgic decor
For anyone who has not previously stopped here, <br> they are in for a treat. Old-fashioned food, service, and decor. Definitely a small town/home <br> town feel.For those of us who have previously eaten at Jiffy,  we always look forward to <br> going back whenever we are in Smith Center.
